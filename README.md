### Please put your [Matrix](https://element.io) ID somewhere in your Microsoft™ Github™ profile.  
Because if someone wants to contact you to talk about e.g. issues, PRs, translation, other contributions, they might want to use Matrix.  
Especially, if you check your Matrix account more often than your e-mail account.


**Tip:** If you don't want to get spam to your e-mail address, you can configure your Matrix ID in the Git config. (Works with the [Pijul](https://pijul.org) version control system too.)
```bash
# Example:
git config --global user.email @notramo:grin.hu
```

**Magyar Linux rajongóknak:**  
Nézzetek szét Matrixon a grin.hu szerver szobalistájában!  
**For Hungarian Linux fans:**  
Take a look at the room directory of the grin.hu Matrix server.  

See the repositories starred by me for some really cool stuff.

My favourite language is [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org). Take a look if you are not familiar with it yet!  
I also like [Zig](https://ziglang.org), and V lang.

I prefer [Sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org), the [Pijul Nest](https://nest.pijul.org), or at least GitLab over Microsoft™ Github™.  
Sourcehut is self-hostable too, like GitLab, but it has the most lightweight web UI (and everything works without JS!), and follows the UNIX philosophy (you can create multiple issue trackers for one code repo, but you can also use one issue tracker for multiple repos, etc.).

[Matrix](https://element.io): @notramo:grin.hu  
I still use e-mail too: `notramo` (I use ProtonMail with the `com` TLD).
