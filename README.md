See the repositories starred by me for some really cool stuff.

My favourite language is [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org). Take a look if you are not familiar with it yet!  
I also like [Zig](https://ziglang.org).

I prefer [Sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org), the [Pijul Nest](https://nest.pijul.org), or at least GitLab over Microsoft™ Github™.  
Sourcehut is self-hostable too, like GitLab, but it has the most lightweight web UI (and everything works without JS!), and follows the UNIX philosophy (you can create multiple issue trackers for one code repo, but you can also use one issue tracker for multiple repos, etc.).

I still use e-mail too: `notramo` (I use ProtonMail with the `com` TLD).
